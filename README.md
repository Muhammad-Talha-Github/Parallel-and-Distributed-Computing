# Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing
A parallel Laplace equation solver implemented in C++ using both OpenMP and MPI. The project compares shared-memory (OpenMP) and distributed-memory (MPI) approaches, tested and benchmarked on a high-performance supercomputer. Includes performance analysis and communication between processes for large-scale matrix computations.
